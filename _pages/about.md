I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at the
University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Prior to joining UCSD, I completed
an interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Computer Sciences and Education at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison).

I study equitable and effective ways to teach computing to a diverse set of
learners. Specifically, I focus on designing and evaluating student-centered
approaches for teaching computing to non-native English speakers; study the role
of live-coding, an active learning technique to teach programming for beginning
programmers; develop innovative methods to teach a second programming language
to people who already know how to program in a different language.

I deeply care about diversity in computing. While at UW-Madion, I designed and
developed a mobile app development workshop for increasing the participation of
under represented minorities (women, people of color, latinx, etc) in computing;
taught scratch programming to elementary school children in Madison; and lead
numerous outreach activities to introduce computing to different types of people.
