title: Live coding
description: In this project, we study the effectiveness of live-coding, an active learning technique for teaching and learning programming. Live-coding is a pedagogical model in which an instructor writes code lively before the students and thinks aloud while doing so to make his/her thought processes visible. This pedagogy is based on an educational theory called Cognitive Apprenticeship which places emphasis on making the process of programming explicit to the students rather than focusing solely on the end product (i.e., a fully written program).
