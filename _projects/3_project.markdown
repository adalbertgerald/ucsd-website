title: Teaching a second programming language to people who can program in a different language
description: How to teach a programming language to someone who already knows programming? To answer this question, we designed, developed, and taught a modern C++ course at UW-Madison. In our novel approach, we taught the most useful ideas first (e.g., C++ standard library) and taught the low-level details (e.g., memory management using pointers, the rule of three/five/zero) only when they were necessary to solve some problem.
